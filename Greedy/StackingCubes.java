// Stacking Cubes
// Problem Description

// You are given A cubes that are of the same size. You are allowed to stack cubes on top of each other.

// You should choose P cubes from the A cubes, such that you should stack all the remaining cubes on top of the P cubes, and each of the P cubes should have equal number of cubes on top of them.

// Find and return the number of ways you can stack cubes on top of each other in the given manner.

// NOTE: Every cube has to be stacked, you cannot have unstacked cubes. No stack can consist of a total of just one cube.



// Problem Constraints
// 2 <= A <= 105



// Input Format
// First and only argument is an integer A denoting number of cubes.



// Output Format
// Return an integer denoting the number of ways you can stack cubes on top if each other in the above given manner.



// Example Input
// Input 1:

//  A = 2
// Input 2:

//  A = 6


// Example Output
// Output 1:

//  1
// Output 2:

//  3


// Example Explanation
// Explanation 1:

//  Only one cube is stacked on another cube.
// Explanation 2:

//  You can have 5 cubes stacked on one cube, or 2 cubes stacked on one cube with a total of two stacks, 
//  or 1 cube stacked on one cube with a total of 3 stacks.
